\title{Summary of base pair frequencies}
\usage{
gl.report.bases(x, plot = TRUE, v = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{-- name of the DArT genlight object [required]}

\item{plot}{-- if TRUE, histograms of base composition are produced [default TRUE]}

\item{v}{-- verbosity: 0, silent or fatal errors; 1, begin and end; 2, progress log ; 3, progress and results summary; 5, full report [default 2]}
}
\value{
Matrix containing the percent frequencies of each base (A,C,T,G) and the transition and transversion frequencies.
}
\description{
This script calculates the frequencies of the four bases, and the frequency of transitions and
transversions in a DArT genlight object.
}
\details{
The script checks if trimmed sequences are included in the locus metadata, and if so, tallies up
the numbers of A,T,G and C bases. Only the reference state at the SNP locus is counted. Counts of transitions
and transversions assume that there is no directionality, that is C>T is the same as T>C, because
the reference state is arbitrary.
