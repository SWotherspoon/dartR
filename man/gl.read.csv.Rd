\title{Read SNP data from a csv file into a genlight object}
\usage{
gl.read.csv(filename, ind.labels = TRUE, loc.labels = TRUE,
  ind.metafile = NULL, loc.metafile = NULL, v = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{filename}{-- name of the csv file containing the SNP genotypes [required]}

\item{ind.labels}{-- if TRUE, then the first column of the csv file is the individual/specimen/sample labels [default TRUE]}

\item{loc.labels}{-- if TRUE, then the first row of the csv file is the locus labels [default TRUE]}

\item{ind.metafile}{-- name of the csv file containing the metadata for individuals [optional]}

\item{v}{-- verbosity: 0, silent or fatal errors; 1, begin and end; 2, progress log ; 3, progress and results summary; 5, full report [default 2]}

\item{ind.metafile}{-- name of the csv file containing the metadata for individuals [optional]}
}
\value{
a genlight object with the SNP data and associated metadata included.
}
\description{
This script takes SNP genotypes from a csv file, combines them with individual and locus metadata and creates a genlight object.
}
\details{
The SNP data need to be in one of two forms. SNPs can be coded 0 for homozygous reference, 2 for homozygous alternate, and 1 for heterozygous with NA for missing values; or
it can be coded A/A, A/C, C/T, G/A etc, with -/- as missing. Other formats will thow an error.

The individual metadata needs to be in a csv file, with headings, with a mandatory id column corresponding exactly to the identities provided with the SNP data. The locus metadata needs
to be in a csv file with headings. Note that the locus metadata will be complemented by calculable statistics corresponding to those that would be provided by Diversity Arrays
